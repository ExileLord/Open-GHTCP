Fixed (Hack v1.0.0):
- Charts can have a fret mask up to 31 (basically allows for importing tap notes)
- Songs can be exported as chart files, not just DBC/QBC
- Fixed an issue where DBC/QBC files song info (title, artist, sections...) weren't getting added
- Setlists can be exported as a folder of chart files
- Mids can be imported with forced and tap notes (Uses raphaelgoulart and Mark Heaths midi2chart converter instead of maxxkillers)
- Added option for midis to be imported with Rock Band 3s mid format ((Uses raphaelgoulart and Mark Heaths midi2chart converter as well)


Known Issues:
- FLAC's do not import
- Song Editor does not display charts
